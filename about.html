		The eerie calls of Common Loons<sup>1</sup> echo across clear lakes of the northern wilderness<sup>2</sup>. Summer adults are regally patterned<sup>3</sup> in black and white<sup>4</sup>. In winter, they are plain gray above and white below<sup>5</sup>, and you&rsquo;ll find them close to shore on most seacoasts<sup>6</sup> and a good many inland reservoirs and lakes<sup>7</sup>. Common Loons are powerful, agile divers that catch small fish in fast underwater chases<sup>8</sup>. They are less suited to land<sup>9</sup>, and typically come ashore only to nest<sup>10</sup>.

  We jump back in time to more than 500 million years ago. What type of equipment should we bring? Camera? Sure. Food? 
  Yes. What else? How about a boat? That&rsquo;s right! The Illinois of long ago, back in the early 
  Paleozoic Era (Fig. 1), was often under the water of a shallow, warm ocean - like the Bahamas, 
  but with no palm trees or resort hotels!
<br><br><sup>3</sup> 				<em>Did you tell him you loved him? </em>
		  No, I looked at him and saw only hollowness; a shell of the world that has been left for us.
				<em>The outcome was predetermined. What did you expect?</em>
		  Nothing, I was taught from the beginning to expect nothing, to believe in nothing.
				<em>Maybe that was only the first lesson.</em>

  Feb. 15, 1990: [NAME REDACTED] of Champaign sorts produce at Diana Foods in Champaign by flashlight. The store, which was without power,

  Feb. 21, 1990: [NAME REDACTED], 14, does his homework by candle and fading window light as his family begins a second week without power. 
  Their generator needed repair.
<br><br><sup>6</sup>  There is a field on what used to be the southwest side of town where the topsoil is swirling dramatically and always upwards. 
(Childhood is an endless autumn here.) There is an old barn right there on the corner that has looked ready to tip over for as long as I can remember.. 
Maybe it will soon. Or maybe it did way back when and I&rsquo;m just forgetting about how they replaced it, and now this is the new one, but now it'&rsquo;
's old, or poorly maintained, and ready to tip over again. Every year the field a shrinking backdrop to those kitchen windows on the vanguard of our odd 
progress. Somehow this is the field I like to think about when I think about what this place was like when it was an ocean. 
(Someday the seasons won't matter anymore.)
